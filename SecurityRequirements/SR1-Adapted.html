	Site may use HTTP Headers such as HSTS to force users to be SSL (not available in HTTP)
	Site may use an Extended Validation Certificate

Session cookie must be securised and Session ID must be protected
	Session cookie must be securised
		Not shared between sub-domains
		Transmitted in HTTPS only
		Not accessible by JavaScript (HTTP-Only)
	Session ID must be protected
		Never disclosed outside of cookie
		Must change and be discarded at logout

Audit trail must be implemented
	Trail of unauth attempts
	Trail of login
	Trail of modifications

A dashboard containing updates and users lists must be implemented
	A user list must be generated (Already fullfiled by Drupal)
		The list must provide historical records on past accounts
		The list may be linkable with a global dashboard

Drupal updates must be planned for common security issues

DevOps security considerations
	Website must be backuped and with diaster recovery features
		Backups of data must not be transmitted in the clear, put in public accessible storage or may be encrypted

	Updates must be planned for common security issues
		PHP issues
		Server issues

	Infrastructure server must be publicly accessible only by HTTP/HTTPS
		Direct access or file transfert access to server must be protected by an ACL

	Code must be protected
		Repository of code must be password protected
		Deployment must be securised (transport security and authentification required)

	Data must be protected
		Access to production database should be limited
		Database transferts should be securised (transport + auth)


Server configuration security considerations
	HTTP site must redirect to SSL site passing parameters using a whitelist approach
	Site may use HTTP Headers such as HSTS to force users to be SSL (not available in HTTP)
	Content type of Website outputs must be enforced
	Click jacking must be mitigated trought HTTP headers


User accounts must follow security policy

Coding security considerations
	Authentification must be required for administrative functions
		Access controls with roles must be used using the least privilege principle
		Brute force attempts must be mitigated
		Security must be enforced server-side not client-side
		Special attention should be given on rich text editors such as tinymce

	Code must consider security mitigation
		against SQL injections
		against XSS attacks
		against exec or eval commands injection
		against CSRF attacks
		Development framework must be used and not bypassed

	Sensitive information or actions must be transmitted securely
		By using SSL (HTTPS)
			TLS (SSL) must be used to any backend connections outside local LAN perimeter
				Connection should fail if certificate is invalid
		By using POST actions instead of GET
